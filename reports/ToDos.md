# To-Dos

## Priority

1. calculate capital gains
2. print numbers in descending order of NAV amounts (maybe use itertools.groupby)
3. add sanity checks
4. add checks to ensure that csv generated by cli is correct
5. further testing (match manual and code-calculated numbers)

## Maybe

1. keep track of expense ratios
2. get a text/ pdf report with visual aids like charts and curves (no requirement so far)
3. get curve of amt invested vs month
4. no. of folios by fund
5. get number of SIPs and their dates and amounts by code. SIP chart - x axis shows dates in a month and y shows amount
6. treatment of reversals in LTCG calculation - not needed I think because -ve sign and some simple eyeballing
7. adding args to main.py

## Require Manual Updates

(constants.py)

1. new transaction types
2. new funds for category mapping

## Done

    - get total amount invested
    - Lumpsum vs SIP
    - top level summary- no. of amc, funds, folios
    - get total amount invested by AMC
    - get total amount invested by scheme
    - get % distribution in LC/MC/SC/L&MC...
    - add filename arg
    - proper documentation so that no time gone next time
    - fetch all long term capital gains eligible purchase transactions
    - currency formatting

    - how to treat redemptions?
      --compare units in folio and scheme subtract from 1st?---> complex
      --sum all except redemption. Rest of the claculation will require manual input
      --have another function for redeemed funds
